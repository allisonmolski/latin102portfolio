This is an illustration based off of the translation 2 assignment, where Nessus is carrying Deianira across the river until he is shot with Hercules’ arrows. 
The illustration connects to the idea expressed in the translation that Nessus gives Deianira his blood and tells her it is a love potion as he is dying, 
as he appears to be reaching for the arrow in his chest in the art, “sanguinem suum … Deianira dedit”. 
Although it’s difficult to interpret, Deianira does not look upset at the fact that Nessus is dying underneath her in the piece of art. 
This would correspond to the additional idea in the translation that she is happy to receive a love potion from Nessus, 
because she fears Hercules is in love with the other women instead of her and wants to give him a love potion, “id philtrum else dixit”. 
Overall, this piece of art seems to accurately represent the ideas presented in the passage that was analyzed in translation 2.
