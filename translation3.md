Translation

One day, Hercules cleaned up the manure of King Augeas’s stall for the greater part, with Jupiter helping; with the river having been sent, he washed out all the manure.
He brought up the living bull, out of Crete to Mycenae, with whom Pasiphae had laid.
Hercules killed the king of Thrace, Diomedes, and his four horses, who fed upon human flesh, with his slave Abderus; moreover, the names of the horses were Podargus, Lampon, Xanthus, and Dinus.

Augeae regis stercus bobile uno die *purgavit*,
>maiorem partem Iove *adiutore*; 
>>flumine *admisso*

B. Grammatical Questions
1. Iove is ablative, it is talking about the means of doing something.
2. Stercus is accusative because it is the direct object of the verb purgavit, meaning to clean.
3. maiorem is accusative, masculine, singular
4. Absolute ablative
5. Masculine, plural, nominative, and the antecedent are the four horses
6. The form of to be is implied in the sentence in the past tense. It is referring to the names of the horses "the horses were named"

C. Literary Commentary
In this passage, the phrase “with his slave Abderus” to describe who 
is killing the king and horses in addition to Hercules is very interesting. 
This is because it highlights the role of the servant to listen and follow everything 
Hercules commands of him, but it also shows the power of which 
Abderus has over a king in order to get away with killing him. 
Without this phrase, the reader would only know Hercules killed the 
king and would not be surprised by that since he has killed many people. 
Additionally, the verb “concubuit” manages to paint a very graphic picture 
for the audience when it comes to Pasiphae’s relationship with an animal. 
Although, I do believe it is essential to the passage in order to convey that specific message, 
which would be completely different if any other vocab word was used here.
