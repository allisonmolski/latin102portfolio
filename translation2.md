Cum moriar



C. Translation
Deianira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the large river, whose name was Evenus, and asked the centaur, Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nephele, for help. This man wished to injure, after having liften Deianira across the river himself. To this place, when Hercules had intervened and when Deianira implored for his protection, he pierced Nessus with arrows. That man, as he was dying, when he knew that the arrows of the Lernean Hydra, which had been moistened with poisonous liquid, had great strength, gave his blood, which had been taken out, to Deianira and said that it was a love potion.
